# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection in CFPs using a CNN
Training a convolutional neural network that can determine the presence of diabetic retinopathy in color fundus photographs of the retina, a binary classification task.

# Instructions
Code Instructions:
1. The file must be run on Google Colab.
2. Add the final_photos_all.zip file to your google drive (My Drive). Make sure that it is NOT located in any folders, otherwise the program will not run properly. NOTE: final_photos_all is not publicly available, please contact me by email if you wish to run the code.
3. To make training faster, make sure to enable GPU usage (Edit -> Notebook Settings -> GPU -> save).
4. Upon first run, you will have to authenticate Google Drive in the first cell.
5. If it doesn’t run properly (might’ve missed something to add here), please contact me by email, ssong21@amherst.edu.
